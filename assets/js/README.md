### Online Claerance System

## Project Description
Online clearance form is a web based system that aims to digitalize the process of clearance process at the learning institutions.

The main purpose is to reduce the amount of time and efforts wasted on studentsâ€™ clearance as well as reduce cost incurred on paper by the institution. Another advantage is that students can also initiate and monitor their clearance status from any location they are thereby eliminating the need to travel or be physically present.

## Purpose
This system was developed as a final project for our pre prep Access Course. The whole class was divided into teams of 4 members and each team was assigned a particular project which they were to work on.  The project was then split and each member in a group was assigned to a module to work on.At the end the team was to discuss and resolve the issues that they are facing and ultimately take their developed modules and integrate all the modules together into one working system. This exercise made us familiar with the issues that occur during the integration of modules in real software projects.

## How to Run
In order to have a look at the code files and understand the working, simply clone or download this repository and open it in your vscode. It will load the project files and the code will be ready to run.

Before running the app, instal xampp for windows or lampp for linux to make a php connection to the mysql database.
